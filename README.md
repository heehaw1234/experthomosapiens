Orbital is NUS School of Computing’s self-directed, independent software development project. This project is developed by team **expert homo sapiens**.

**Proposed Level of Achievement:** Project Gemini

---

## 🎯 Introducing Our Platform

A centralized platform for NUS students to access academic resources, connect with tutors, and get help on their modules.  
This web app integrates **note sharing**, **a tutoring network**, and **a course-specific Q&A forum**.

---

## 💡 Motivation

NUS students face fragmented access to academic resources like notes and tutoring. Existing platforms (Studocu, unofficial chats) often:

- Require paid access
- Contain outdated materials
- Lack verified or quality-controlled content

This project aims to centralize all essential academic support in one platform.

---

## 🧭 Aims

To build an all-in-one academic support system that provides:

- Verified note sharing
- Peer and professional tutoring
- Course-specific discussion forums
- Personalized student dashboards
